# meetup-ngc-esbuild

## Angular builder is the thief who steals your time.
> Angular is a fantastic framework, and I am a fan of it. 
> But the development team of Angular did not care about writing a new builder; instead, they used Webpack. 
> It was a time-saving decision, but Webpack is too complicated and sluggish.  

__Let us develop a new builder based on Esbuild because Esbuild is 100 times faster than Webpack.__

## Agenda:
- We review the steps of creating an own Angular builder
- I introduce my work on my new builder, 
- You can ask questions about the Angular building process
- You can participate in this fantastic job (if you want)
