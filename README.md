# meetup-ngc-esbuild

## Angular builder is a thief who steals your time.
> Angular is a fantastic framework but the development team did not 
write a new builder; instead, they used Webpack. 
> It was a time-saving decision, but Webpack is too complicated and sluggish.  

__Let's develop a new builder based on Esbuild because it's 100 times faster than Webpack.__

## Agenda:
- Review the steps of creating our own Angular builder
- Create a test application and measure the performance
- Q&A on the Angular building process
- Find out how to participate in this fantastic job (if you want)
